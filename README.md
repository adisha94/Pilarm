# Pilarm
This is a program that can be run on your raspberry pi to easily wake  up your roomates so that they can know that you are near.
So far the only way to access the program without you being close to your pi is to make sure that you can access the pi when you are not in the house. I'll work on a solution to this limitation soon, but for now the base application and purpose works just fine.
